# Farm2Cart
I’m presenting a console-based vegetable shopping application developed in Python. It allows users to select vegetables by number, add quantities, manage their cart, and receive a receipt — all with bilingual support in English and Hindi. The idea is to simplify the vegetable shopping process and make it culturally inclusive.
